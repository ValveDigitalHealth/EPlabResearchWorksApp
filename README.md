App GUI is based on C++Builder by Embarcadero (https://www.embarcadero.com/). It is possible to obtain free Community license for non-profit use.

ATTENTION: This is by no means 'production standard' code. Please treat it rather as a repository from which various algorithms/methods/approaches can be extracted and learned from. But of course, if you would use whole app adding your own modification, it is also viable way to go.
